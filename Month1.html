                            The first month has come to an end, and I personally think that it was very good. 
                            I’ll start talking about the ego is the enemy and make it stick books. These books 
                            were really enlightening, and I think they were made specifically for someone like me, 
                            that is starting in the world of development and that had and has many issues with 
                            managing my confidence and how I learn. The lessons I took away from this were being 
                            humble, but at the same time striving for greatness always trying to learn. It’s a fine 
                            line between accepting you don’t know stuff, but believing you’re capable of doing 
                            anything that is assigned to you, and these books explained it very well in my opinion.

                            Other things I noticed while reading the book ego is the enemy is that many of the ideas 
                            stated in it were things that we’ve already been doing in the time I’ve been in Nearsoft, 
                            I can see a great influence from this book in the culture of the company or at least the 
                            mindset stated. It’s not worth much being a big fish in a small pond, so I’m very happy 
                            to be in a big pond like here.

                        <strong>
                            The other monthly activity was the “Learning how to learn” course. From this I obtained 
                            a lot of little techniques that I’m sure I will be using in the near future, especially 
                            now that I have so much to learn. The thing that was great about the course was realizing 
                            that many of the things explained there were things that we do without noticing, like chunking, 
                            but now being aware of that I think I will be able to start chunking with purpose enhancing my 
                            learning process, and I loved Barbara Oakley.

                            The content for the month was pretty interesting too, and while at first I didn’t understand 
                            much of it little by little with the help of others and information from the internet I started 
                            getting a better grasp of it. For example, in the google code jam problem I was pretty lost at first, 
                            I had never used Go, but I tried to understand everything and followed the instructions from peers and 
                            my mentors to be able to finish that activity, and while I was not entirely sure of what I was doing, 
                            later in the month during the movie recommender, I remembered many of the things I learned from the videos, 
							books, course & people in NS that I talked to. Don't feel pressured or stuipd for not understanding something 
							at first, and don't just break your mind into doing something, people recommended many methods but one that 
							really stuck with me was writing a todo list for the week and applying fake deadlines to some of these activities 
							that way I would no procrastinate so much, but don't just apply a deadline and leave it like that, also tell 
							some of your friends and partners to help you by reminding you of these deadlines so that you get that fake 
							pressure from all sides aso you start to believe that those deadlines are true as well, pomodoro helped a 
							lot as well. All of that got me to the point that I was explaining how to do things to others in the end, 
							and I think, that was one of my greatest achievements this month, being a helping hand to others it felt 
							really great being a reliable source of information for others.
