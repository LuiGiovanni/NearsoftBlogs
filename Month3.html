                        Another month in the bag, I feel that I’m starting to get the hang of how to work this out, there is a lot to talk about. I will try to keep it short, first off, let us talk about myself, and my growth during these last 3 months. I must face it; I am the biggest nervous wreck you will ever find sometimes; I tend to worry too much about what my work will say about me that out of fear or timidness I don’t go along with my ideas which causes me to be held back by no one other than myself. Which is the worst thing I could ever do but I had a talk with the academy staff (of course I was as nervous as ever) they talked to me about this and other things I mentioned in one of my blogs which hit me hard, it made me realize that many ideas I had really could have been a better solution not just in programming but also in everyday life as well, but I hold myself back, so I don’t get judged by others on dumb ideas or what may seem like dumb ideas, but this is just a bump in the road for me, this won’t hold me back on growing and maturing as a person or a an employee here at Encora.  
                        <br><br>
                        I realize that due to this it means I must work harder than a normal person, and I sure am willing to do it, it will be hard, but my dreams from the first few talks and ideals are still there, my aim is still clear there is just some rocks in the way so I must take my time not to trip and fail, but that’s just not an option for me, not out of necessity but out of my mindset, I want to succeed and prove that my mistakes don’t define me, I am more than a few mistakes that I don’t understand at first and I know what I am capable of doing. I just must pay more attention and mature more this knowledge that I have gained these past few months. I will get there, you’ll see. I hope one day somebody in my position in future academy batches can read this and get something out of it. 
                        <br><br>
                        Now that we are done talking about myself let’s talk about this phase itself, honestly? I wish I could’ve done more, there were some hiccups at first due to my own issues with how I worked like I explained above, something I was rectifying in the second half of this phase, my problem was I took it to an extreme, I started asking less questions and just trying to resolve everything by myself and by the time I understood there's nothing wrong with asking questions, the holidays started to kick in, luckily there were still people out there willing to help me and if I could I would mention their names since I am really grateful for all the help, be it either big or small, it was enough to keep me going and inspire me to work harder, sure I can accept that there were still some mistakes made, but I learn from them, like we saw a few months ago, there is no perfect-god mode-programmer and we don’t know everything, stop putting pressure on yourself, is something I would say often these days, work hard, give it you all and if it doesn't work out at least you know that what you did doesn't work and you can try a different route, at least you’ll know that you gave it your all. 
                        <br><br>
                        The communities themselves were great! They guided and explained in the best ways possible, I felt accepted no matter how much or how little knowledge I had I will continue to contribute with them since this is something I love, and they have been so great and kind to me. Look them up on <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach">Cockroach</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork">TensorNetwork</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems">Ruby Gems</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">Jax</a>. 
                        <br><br>
                        In short, this month was great for me mentally and I am grateful for the opportunity I have here, if all goes well, I will still be here next week, and year (ha-ha new year's joke) I have a call tomorrow with the academy staff and I always get nervous on 1on1’s since I never know what to expect and overthink things, but this time I feel relaxed, no matter what happens I did my best and I know I can do even more, here’s to them seeing the same as me, but even if I leave I want to thank them, so much for all the guidance, for believing in me and giving me a chance to show what I am capable of, I really do love this place, they have treated me so good. So I hope to see you next week here with another explanation on what crazy things I am doing with Encora academy!
