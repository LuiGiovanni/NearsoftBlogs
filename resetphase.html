						<h3>Make it stick</h3>
						<p align="justify">
							This is a book about education and learning and how to increase your learning and how to actually make what 
							youâ€™re learning stick. I thought this was a really interesting book that anyone with an interest in teaching 
							or learning will benefit from reading this work.
						</p>

						<h3>Ego is the enemy</h3>
						<p>
							Ego is the Enemy uses history and culture to warn readers that ego and pride can make you fall off the right 
							track while emphasizing the importance of staying down-to-earth to help reach your goals.
