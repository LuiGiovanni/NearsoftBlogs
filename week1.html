							This is the first week of lightning talks so the reading and viewing material was light, still there was a lot to learn and much self reflection to be had. 
							From what people and culture is (From now on i will say P&C) to religion and how as communities we follow a sort of religion all the way to understanding how progress works, 
							there's much to be learned so let’s now waste anymore time and get straight to it. 
							<br/><br/>
							We got to meet our P&C who explained what their role is and that of all her team is, 
							she's been here for 6 years so any doubt I know she will know how to fix or at the very least have an idea for a solution. 
							She made us feel as if we were not another in the pack but an important part of the Nearsoft community as a whole.
							<br><br>
							There was also an explanation on what the hub is and the whole vision they had when creating it and she helped us create accounts, 
							she really stressed the importance of adding info on the accounts so that others could know more of us.

							<h2>How to talk to anyone</h2>
							<br>
							<i>"There are two types of people in life"</i>
							<br>

							<strong>
								<i>"Those who enter the room and say ‘Here I am!’, and those that say ‘There you are!’"</i>
								<br><br>
								This comes from a summary of the book How to talk to anyone by Leil Lowndes, the summary was written by Derek Sivers.
								<br><br>
								Never believe that you can get to the top alone, teamwork and cooperation gets you farther than you can do by yourself, 
								the first impression is important the way you move and how you look is 80% of this first impression so try to make it the best for them, 
								i am guilty of not following this to a tee, there could be some improvement on how i present myself honestly i just try to be real and honest 
								to whoever meets me i don’t want people to have a different idea of who i am and cause confusion in the future. 
								The lecture talks about having a flooding smile and this i do feel i put into practice very much i always try to make them feel as if i am happy to see them, 
								which is almost always, i am a firm believer that everyone is valuable and should be shown that they matter.
								<br><br>
								I noticed that most of these techniques i already put into practice unconsciously which is a good thing, though the ones i don’t are very important and i should start doing as well, 
								i found the fact that you shouldn’t tease very important, yes it could give you some instant gratification but in the long run it will hurt you, besides why should you look to offend others for you own benefit? It makes no sense to me.
								<br><br>
								<h2>John Ousterhout Quotes</h2>
								Honestly while reading quotes, it makes you reevaluate your way of thinking, i mean he broke some well established beliefs of mine, for example, 
								i always felt that saying “i don’t know” makes me look like a fool and is a disgrace, but no! You can be wrong, NO ONE KNOWS EVERYTHING and yes 
								i know this seems obvious but sometimes you feel embarrassed to even accept this, but you will never learn or grow if we can’t accept this fact!
								<br><br>
								<h3><i>“The greatest performance improvement of all is when a system goes from not working to working”<br></i></h3>
								We try to worry so much on how fast our code runs, but honestly modern systems don’t really need you to concentrate so much on that, 
								if you focus so much on it you lose sight on the quality of the system or even worse on how fast you finish the system. 
								Yes performance may be important but focus on it once the project is done, usually simple algorithms are fast enough.
								<br><br>
								<h3><i>“Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them”<br></i></h3>
								If we get used to our “gut feeling” being right we start to consider intuition as a verified fact and not as what it really is, 
								a simple hypothesis on which we could work to establish a truly infallible fact, doing this could lead to mistakes because of our own overconfidence.
								<br><br>
								<h3><i>“If you don’t know what the problem was, you haven’t fixed it”<br></i></h3>
								Understanding what caused the issue gives you the experience and insight to resolve similar problems in the future, 
								just fixing it without understanding what happened will only give you instant gratification and if a similar situation pops up, the same solution might not work.
								<br><br>
								<h2>The art of feedback and X workflow</h2>
								It’s interesting to see how Nearsoft works as a company or should i say as a conglomerate of various teams that form a big team, which looks for the integral growth to benefit the company and ourselves, 
								and how it contrasts itself to other companies which look for a vertical growth which breeds competition and in the end rivalry with each other, this is where X workflow comes in as they also suggest you to think of a company as a single team. 
								For me this is what i normally thought and it’s interesting to see that normally we always seek personal growth, striving to reach the top and this causes a lot of rivalry with our coworkers.
								<br><br>
								Journaling or a research journal seems like a nice practice to do, personally i already do this, but seeing this as a suggestion or as a good practice is reassuring, knowing that some of what i’m already doing is actually a good practice. 
								In general X workflow is very good way to work out the solutions of problems and to understand them in very deep way, just trying to solve a problems creates problems but truly understanding what the situation is gives you a better insight 
								on how to solve these problems and for a software developer this is very important I will definitely put these in practice for the future to make them a habit.
								<br><br>
								<h2>Religion, Evolution & the ecstasy of self transcendence</h2>
								See how we have come together as a community similarly to wasp was very insightful and the idea that we all (in a sense) follow something like a religion and how transcending to a mindstate where the good of the community is more important than personal growth is pretty interesting and as i said earlier is a good way to think.
								<br><br>
								That comparison of how war follows this idea really made me think, nothing brings people together more than war, you got that right, the same goal makes people forget personal growth and you focus on achieving the same goal <i>“I may fall but i will not die since my comrades will continue my fight”</i>. 
								Yes this is honestly an extreme case and the ideal may be a bit skewed here still the idea remains, even darwin believed something similar just see this he said.
								<br><br>
								<i>“Selfish and contentious people will not cohere and without coherence nothing can be effected”.</i>
								<br><br>
								This is so true, if you only focus on you growth in the group you are only a hindrance and in the end the group will fail, creating a free rider problem and it is really scary how fast it can all break down with just one person with this idea.
								<br><br>
								<h2>Creative thinking hacks & How Progress works</h2>
								Talk is cheap, saying you will do things is never going to work, get shit done and let the results talk for you, both of these talks are from Scott Berkun and he also mentions the fact that using journals to capture your ideas no matter how simple they are is a very way to be more creative same as what X workflow suggest, 
								which confirms that this is truly a good practice, also being in the shower helps a lot to come up with good ideas since is a truly solitary moment and that helps your brain think and not concentrate on receiving information. 
								<br><br>
								Having a partner to help you grow is a really good idea and in a workplace is even better since it generates growth for both of you, and this relates to what I stated earlier to look for integral growth which will in the end make the whole company grow with you, just look at some examples! Steve Jobs & Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates & Paul Allen, 
								Jeff Dean & Sanjay Ghemwat! I find it funny how sometimes even a rival could help just like Da vinci & Michaelangelo.
								<br><br>
								Normally as humans we avoid change, we fear it since it creates work, requires thinking and embarrassment, and in this modern world since we have no need for risks we tend to avoid changes which create risks, but if we live in a mediocre mindstate we will have mediocre progress. And as i said earlier, don’t state your ideas and try to sell them without execution, 
								state the problem you want to solve and then how you will solve it.
								<br><br>
								A great way to create progress is to have power so that you can convince people of your ideas no matter the risk, also being persuasive helps a lot to collect support for these ideas. Create an idea and don't try to build the whole project you may be rejected or i may need some changes so now you wasted all that time on nothing, 
								start with a small version as a pilot then go and show this successful pilot to people to obtain support and followers and allies, then ask for more resources to make your pilot grow, repeat the previous steps and at some point you project will be profitable.
								<br><br>
								<h2>Conclusions</h2>
								This week had a very clear message, being more creative, focus on personal growth so that your progress helps the whole community you are in and let your accomplishments help the whole group and many ways to be able to create progress, in various areas not only academic but also on how to develop your soft skills. 
								Many of the reading material was great and very fruitful for me, I found many suggestions and tips that I feel I already did but many as well that I should do, the mindset I should acquire is one that may seem far but with time and with the right habits I will arrive at a progressive mindset.
