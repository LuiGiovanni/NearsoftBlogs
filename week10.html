                            This week was nerve wrecking, looking for issues on open-source projects to work on, seeing if they respond, and if they like you PR (Pull request). Setting up all the dependencies and you working environment as well as playing around with the project to understand it better, yes, we code and we understand what happens in most part of code by reading it, but there is just so much reading code can do, trying it out for yourself and playing around with the project itself can give you a second perspective of what is going on. 
                            <br><br>
                            One of the biggest lessons I learned this week or at least that impacted me in a huge way was, we are not in school anymore, contributing to issues in open source projects is for you to help develop something you love, for me that is and will always be Machine learning and being able to add something to a project that is close to this is incredible and more when that project is from Google, it is called TensorNetwork and it is a library that simplifies the manipulation of Tensor networks, currently I am adding some methods that the authors would like to add, yes, it is a simple contribution but knowing that when I work on ML projects and I call a specific function, that I implemented makes me excited I might keep contributing to issues in the future out of love for it. So, do not wait for them to give you the go, fork the repo, clone it, open a branch, and get to work, once you finish, make a pull request. Worst case scenario they reject you PR, but you will still gain the experience and you add something to you list of works so basically you lose nothing at all. 
                            <br><br>
                            But the communities that work these projects normally are active and the love helping newcomers with open arms, I am grateful to all the help they have given me. Of course, my mentors and other Encora partners have helped a lot as well, from small to big issues, it inspires to want to be like that one day, be the person people come to for help, I love helping others and when I have contributed in a major way with someone, it really makes me happy, that one of my biggest motivators for gaining knowledge, the idea of gaining this experience to pass it down to others, you know apprentice and mentor.

							If you are interested on working on an open-source project there are some pages and blog post that can help you in getting started, but nothing beats reading the projects own documentation on how to contribute and speaking to other collaborators, still I recommend these pages, <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/4/get-started-open-source-project?fbclid=IwAR3FegPy8SBTgrlvAtJyC3IHseeVl9Xj6ffAzPwz9QHm7iMprnHqn_0KVGs">opensource.com</a> here I found my Python project, there is a repo on GitHub which has a list of Python open-source projects call <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners?fbclid=IwAR0Z2THJ2Zf2Oru2KOVRBXuwqeV1yP7heW3ppaIt_eWBv7E8-xJqCAQ0owc">awesome-for-beginners</a>.
