                            This week was quite different from the last months, there is this event in the company that happens every year, called “Team Building Week” for the whole week we had multiple events from game tournaments, trivia's, Q&A’s, etc. It showed us exactly how unique and united this team really is, calling it a company by itself is a disservice to what really describes NS Encora. I also had a new specific task to do which was reviewing my partners PR’s and evaluate not only their contribution but their communication as well seeing if what they did was enough, still, I was able to find some time to work on my own issues and find new ones. 
                            <br><br>
                            <h2>What have I been working on? </h2>
                            Well first off let us talk about the issues which have a PR (Pull Request) done. There is adding the Cholesky decomposition to various archives and adding the power function to the similar functions in their backend, both are to the same open-source project called TensorNetwork from Google’s open-source projects. The hard part of these projects was learning how to send my function arguments because for the power function the issue is understanding how the power will be because a will be a value in the tensor and b can either be a scalar or a value of the tensor. For the Cholesky decomposition it is finding exactly what that method does since I have never used it before. 
                            <br><br>
                            There was also this issue about N+1 query issue from a Ruby project called Tracksapp but due to little communication from the team working on this issue I decided to leave it be and look for another issue, in my search I found that Google has a lot of different open-source projects from different stacks and some of them are from Ruby and Go so I am quite sure I will find something to work on. 
                            <br><br>
                            <h2>Team Building Week (TBW) </h2>
							This event was incredible, and it developed a sense of belonging with everyone even though I am not part of Encora yet, it made me excited and inspired to work hard and give everything I have to this academy to learn and develop the correct mind set for this company I cannot see myself anywhere else right now and the respect and love I have developed for the teammates and the company itself is incredible, I am excited to see this event in a non-virtual format next year.
