                            This week some of us had some feedback from the staff here at the academy where they talked to us about our biggest flaw that might affect our path to NS Encora, I admit I was very scared of this at first since I did not exactly know what to expect. Sure, I was expecting some feedback, even I noticed but failed to fix it. Still, I took everything with an open mind as it should be because they are here to help us grow and mature, to be better at our job in every aspect.  
                            <br><br>
                            My PR’s are going great though I am still missing some, I want to go for something strong, something difficult and different that will make me think and challenge my knowledge of the topic and language, that is my mission for this new week, to get beat up (figuratively) by and issue but in the end overcome the challenge. 
                            <h2>Feedback</h2>
                            It was eating at my mind since they scheduled the meeting, millions of different issues running through my mind, and that is exactly my biggest issue, I overthink everything and am too scared to take risks and own the consequences of it, I always try and make sure to everything Is perfect before doing anything, which sometimes is not bad but you cannot plan for everything, I will try to take ownership of what I do and follow NS ideals with GTD (getting things done) after this phase is finished I will start working more on this, mature more and really base these ideas as if they were mine. It is funny you would think that all those talks and reading material with the course would be enough and that I learned well, but sometimes experience is all you need to understand. At least it was not too late for me to learn and grow from this, mistakes are part of growing up and if you fail early on the repercussions are not so big. 
                            <br><br>
                            <h2>My PR’s</h2>
							My power function issue hit a roadblock that I did not cause, and it is bothering me that this issue is present out of nowhere luckily other collaborators are helping me out with this to understand what the issue really is. There is some good news though, my Ruby PR is almost finished. I just need some extra testing and we are done with that one which is exciting, the community in Ruby Gems is nice and active. I have a lot of respect and admiration for them. Still missing a PR for Go which is my third stack, it is a fun language a combination of Python and C++ I find that interesting. 
                            <br><br>
                            Honestly, this whole phase has been fun, I fell in love with the idea of putting my contributions for other open-source projects, the idea of one day using my contributions in my projects is exciting, thinking that one day I might use Tensor Networks power function for my own purposes and knowing that I implemented that is enough to get my stuck in my chare for hours working on every detail and documentation I can. I highly recommend that if you can work on an issue for an open-source project you like it does not have to be something incredible of life changing start small then gain experience.
