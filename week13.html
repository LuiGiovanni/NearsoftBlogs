                            This week was the rush to the finish line, lots of stress and pressure that we put on ourselves, the holidays should be a time to relax, I found myself working on Christmas day on PRs and trying to get everything done, ofcourse they would not review anything today, still everyday I worked helped, I was sadly not able to finish my 6 PRs but I was close, I learned what it means, to work under this much pressure I did fail sometimes but I was able to push through it, nothing is impossible if you grab the right mindset, don't be afraid to show your ideas and try new things, worst thing that can happen is that what you did is not what they are looking for in that case you simply change your solution. I give this advice but know that I am still working to get better at this mindset, it's not easy but well worth the work you put in.
                            <br><br>
                            When it comes to my PRs I was able to find new PRs to work on, and finally my Cholesky and power PRs are close to finished if not already done, and the Ruby PR was done but now they want to work on a bigger solution which seems exciting I will continue to work with them, I also found two new issues, one with Ruby called cockroach and one with Jax Python,. These one are completely different since the cockroach community even accepted me in their slack group for guidance and help which they've given a lot, I appreciate them a lot.
                            <br><br>
                            There is also a blog post I had to do explaining something I am interested in, I chose to talk about lamba expressions and anonymous functions. Specifically for Python, since it is my main stack and thought it would be fun and interesting to explain. I noticed there was something that I did not know about them and found myself hooked and couldn't stop learning more, still I had to condense everything so that I wouldn't be such a long read.
                            <br><br>
							In conclusion this week being the last really made me learn just how encore can work under pressure I can't help but think that maybe it was planned that we failed? I can't shake this thought, still here I am. Working hard, encore really does bring out the best in you even that hard way.
