						<h3>Week 2 <br/> What i've learned</h3>
						
					</section>

					<section>
						<p align="justify"> <strong> 
							This week’s main topic was teamwork and how we can communicate better as a team and with our client, 
							aside from the typical videos (which were really entertaining) there was also our weekly Lightning talk, 
							my topic was why machine learning is cool, once I received my feedback I learned my biggest crutch from this week, 
							my closer was really week and I could’ve done better, but now I know where to focus my progress on. 
							Even though I received some praise for my english and the topic I chose, 
							I want to get better since I am not that fond of speaking in front in people, 
							I thought that since the LT’s would be online I would at least be a little more confident but that did not happen, 
							so now i must work on getting better and relaxing and talking I bit slower so that I can explain everything more accurately. 
						</strong>
						<br><br>
						<strong>
							Most of this week’s videos were about developing our mindset in a work environment, 
							don’t become simple yes-men or cowards that won’t try to make the work area better, 
							also to focus more on ot trying to look like a genius for other people, 
							we all make mistakes that’s what humans do and remember that working for more time doesn't mean more progress, 
							but if you work smart you can produce better results. 
							Linda’s story and her ideas of an agile mindset are incredible and i really loved her disposition and how she expresses her ideas, 
							one phrase that pops to mind is instead of saying “I can’t do something” it’s better to say “I can’t do it well yet, but i’m getting better” 
							and the idea of failing fast to learn more is something that was pushed so much this week, 
							and i followed this mindset when working on the google code jam problem, and boy did it work, 
							instead of getting discouraged for the problem not working i kept at it if i remember i did around 
							22 tries on the code jam page, until i finally saw those three green checkmarks which felt like a rush of adrenaline 
							in my body, it felt awesome.
						</strong>

						<strong>
							I think Dave said it better, “The root cause of why software development doesn't seem to work is people” in 
							around 14 years the average of bugs per 1000 lines of code was the same! The cause for the issues are the people itself, 
							it’s incredible to think that our tools for better software development keep on getting better to the point where some 
							IDE’s even auto correct you problems and we have gotten worse, now we have 15 - 50 bugs per 1000 lines of code 
							(according to Google, of course). The only way to get better a not doing so many bugs is to gain experience, 
							i loved how he explained the progress from Novice all the way to Expert and i found it funny that being proficient 
							feels like going backwards because you discover that what you know is nothing compared to the bigger world out there, 
							and i remembered when i discovered more of ML and i just felt dumb compared to other people thanks to that.
						</strong>
						</p>
						<h3>To wrap things up</h3>
						<strong>
							I feel like i am progressing and i am learning, the knowledge i’ve gained feels incredible because i see a better version of 
							myself than the one i was before starting the academy, i regret the mistakes i made last year but that huge failure made me a 
							better and more responsible person which just excites me for what's to come, i know it won’t be easy but i know it will be fun 
							and a great learning experience so that i can become even better than today, let’s see what comes next!
