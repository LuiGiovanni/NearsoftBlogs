                            Most of this week's work was centered around data sets and data manipulation, 
                            be it with our movie recommendation problem or most of the viewing material, 
                            from Machine Learning (Hype!) to quantum computing, which honestly always 
                            gets me excited to think about, I really hope one day I can work with one 
                            they seem super fun.
                        </strong>
                        <h2>The pale blue dot, moonshot thinking & more!</h2>
						<strong>
                            Short videos, true, but their messages to me seem so important, especially 
                            these days, we only have one place in this vast universe that we can actually 
                            call home and the way we’ve been living is destroying our only actual safe haven.
						</strong>

                            Now moonshot thinking is really interesting, of course it seems impossible at first, 
                            hell, it even seemed counterintuitive to me at first! But the way Astro Teller 
                            explained the idea made me think. That HUGE fact he stated early in the video seemed 
                            really crazy. How can it be easier to make something 10x better than 10% better? 
                            It’s all about the learning moment, yes it’s almost like failure but learning in itself 
                            is not true failure, true failure is not even trying or as Astro explained failure is 
                            when you continue on a project or idea that you KNEW 6 months earlier could have been 
                            dropped to pursue a new and, possibly, better idea. The act of trying and learning 
                            something even from failure is progress or as Astro calls it “Learning moment” 
                            (Keep in mind, in the video Astro says it in a really strange way, and I am just 
                            interpreting the message that he was trying to explain. Hopefully I did it justice).
                        </strong>
                        <strong>
                            The mindset of trying to better the world is awesome and I love this type of ideas, 
                            it’s something that I truly relate to, in one of my previous blogs I actually speak 
                            on this a bit and relay why I wish to work in Machine Learning, there is so much 
                            potential in this field to better the world, to create things that will help the 
                            whole population and give a positive impact on everybody not just myself, I just 
                            hope that I can be a fraction of who creative some ML engineers truly are! Which is 
                            an awesome segway into what most of this week’s focus was on.
                        </strong>
                        <strong>
                            Yes machine learning is pretty freaking cool. That small ML tutorial was really detailed 
                            and explained concepts very well, I even remembered some stuff myself, it felt almost like 
                            someone was teaching me basic mathematics and remembering concepts correctly and confirming 
                            the knowledge I have. I highly recommend this tutorial for anyone wanting to learn a bit more 
                            about ML and maybe even better this could be a start of a beautiful new career path, just don’t 
                            get discouraged with the math involved! 
                        </strong>
                        <strong>
                            Now, speaking of Quantum Computing, is something i don’t really comprehend that much, I feel i 
                            understand the concept of superposition and what qubits are, but like Richard Feynman said: 
                            “If you think you understand quantum physics, you don't” which perfectly describes this new field 
                            but just thinking about what the future holds is super exciting, It’s amazing to think that one day 
                            in my lifetime i will be able to work with a quantum computer, and how our children and grandchildren 
                            will be doing incredible things with them if we guide them correctly, it’s all a matter of time!
                        </strong>

						<h2>Let's wrap it up!</h2>
						<strong>
                            I loved this week, I feel I grew more mentaly. The knowledge just keeps coming and it’s exciting seeing 
                            my partners grow with me and discover their passions and the interpretation they have of different topics, 
                            or how they understand things in their own way. We've had some great conversations and guidance, I just hope 
                            I can also help them when they need me. I am learning so much from them and my mentors, let’s see what next week holds!
