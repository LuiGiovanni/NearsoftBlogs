                            This week was full of testing, automation and computing and science want to touch 
                            on the science and computing part more a bit later, since i am a computer scientist 
                            this area hits right at home and i wish to do it a bit more justice as well as doing 
                            more justice to greats mind in exact science like Richard Feynman and Stephen Wolfram, 
                            along with others.
                        </strong>
                        <h2>Testing and Automation</h2>
						<strong>
                            It's interesting how there are various types of tests that could be made and how 
                            some companies use testing in an efficient and fast way. Google has a really great 
                            system for testing and integration. I was fascinated by how smart of an idea it was, 
                            I feel that Google’s continuous integration really feeds a mindset of keep working 
                            and creating progress, no matter how small. And the numbers show this being true in 
                            their presentation as you could see their only dip in the graph was on december’s holiday.
                        </strong>

						<h2>Computing & Science</h2>
						<strong>
                            Hearing the talks of quantum computing and quantum machine learning at first are a bit 
                            mind bending and intimidating but so interesting, so much so that i started reading more 
                            on this topic, but I feel great about learning if i had a professor like Richard Feynman, 
                            hearing his stories and how he would not be afraid to express his own thoughts and would 
                            always questions if he felt someone was wrong, the stories really inspired me to follow 
                            in a similar way to his mindset and investigate if i was curious about something, never 
                            be afraid to ask questions and just be myself always. I can only strive to be similar to 
                            how he was in the future, one step at a time I guess.
