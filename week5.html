                            This week marks the beginning of our build something from scratch phase and the beginning of our project with our client, a REAL client. Now i can’t go into many details on the project or our client but, the project itself seems pretty interesting and how our mentors have told us, our project is one of the most interesting ideas in the bunch, i’m excited to get to work and communicate with our client, our team had some issues with how we were going to resolve the problem and our ideas were all over the place, in layman's terms, we were overthinking everything.
                        </strong>

                            In the end we seemed to arrive on a solution that worked for most part, there's not that much to talk about, we were let loose and the responsibilities fell solely on us, we set the meetings, we did the talking and the organization, yes we had a lot of help from our academy staff, but we finally get a glimpse of how working at Nearsoft Encora really is. A bit of a side note, more pressure placed on us thanks to the fact that this client is thinking about joining Encora Nearsoft as a client to stay, so basically we are the welcoming party, I plan on putting everything I got to represent Encora Nearsoft in a favorable manner.
