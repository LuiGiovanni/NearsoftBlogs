							This week marks the beginning of our build something from scratch phase and the beginning of our 
							project with our client, a REAL client. Now i can’t go into many details on the project or our client 
							but, the project itself seems pretty interesting and how our mentors have told us, our project is one 
							of the most interesting ideas in the bunch, i’m excited to get to work and communicate with our client, 
							our team had some issues with how we were going to resolve the problem and our ideas were all over the place, 
							in layman's terms, we were overthinking everything.
                        </strong>
						<br><br>
						<strong>
							to be perfectly blunt and honest, we did not do a very good job this first week, I learned that as a team there 
							must be more communication if we want to succeed in this project, sometime we fear of giving our opinion for various 
							reasons maybe you're afraid of looking stupid, or don't want to speak up, or if you're like me you don't to offend or 
							hurt others with you opinions, I found it really hard to express somethings to my team for this exact reason, but the 
							truth is if you don't speak up in the beginning you'll pay for it down the road when things become a bit more challenging 
							to fix and that's why it's important to not only trust in your team but also in yourself, I'm blessed to be with a team 
							that I know I can say anything to, and express myself with them knowing I don't wish to hurt them or insult them, they 
							trust me and of course I do as well.
						</strong>
						<br><br>
						<strong>
							Ofcourse, having great guides helps a lot. Not only our mentors, but staff were of incredible help, and most importantly 
							patient, we are here to learn and this was no more true that this week, the mistakes were many and we learned from them 
							the hard way, luckily we had staffs help to explain and guide us in the correct way of thinking and how to approach the 
							problem, we must not think of this as simple problem solving and trying to find the solution just because we need to 
							solve it, you have to believe that your clients problem is painful and something that is really hurting them, and if 
							they hurt you get hurt as well, you have to understand that they are important, as people and for some reason at least 
							for me, that inspired me to want to create something incredible something that would be so perfect and comfortable to my 
							client.
						</strong>
						<br><br>
						<strong>
							In the end we seemed to arrive on a solution that worked for most part, there's not that much to talk about, 
							we were let loose and the responsibilities fell solely on us, we set the meetings, we did the talking and the 
							organization, yes we had a lot of help from our academy staff, but we finally get a glimpse of how working at 
							Nearsoft Encora really is. A bit of a side note, more pressure placed on us thanks to the fact that this client 
							is thinking about joining Encora Nearsoft as a client to stay, so basically we are the welcoming party, I plan 
							on putting everything I got to represent Encora Nearsoft in a favorable manner.
