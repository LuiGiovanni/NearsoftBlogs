                            This week was a bit weird at first, yes I spoke of communication on my first weekly essay but for some reason I 
                            didn’t apply what I spoke of in that first week, my previous laptop got damaged and I was not able to work for 
                            the first two days, I felt useless and dumb, it was not pleasant, so I hid. I hid from my partners feeling embarrassed 
                            that I was letting them down, they were advancing and i was still stuck on only reading and understanding how 
                            the project will work and what technology we would be using, it wasn’t until Tuesday night when my partners 
                            communicated with me asking how I was doing and how they were worried that I felt inspired, something inside of 
                            me just clicked and I noticed what i was doing and how stupid it was for me to feel like that and that by just 
                            mulling I was doing more harm, I went to collect new equipment from staff and came back with a burning passion 
                            to want to get to work right away and tried to get into anything that needed to be done, but in those 2 days my 
                            partners were really ahead of me, frightening so, granted they were using technologies that they all had practice 
                            with already and i am a newbie to these technologies, so I was behind from the start, still I started helping in 
                            ways I knew would be instant help, and started learning NodeJS and JS itself on the side by myself and frome reading 
                            my partners code.

                            Since I was always focused on ML in college many things related to frontend and backend development seem foregin to me 
                            sometimes, yes I’ve had the experience from college in backend but not as much as I wish, so this is a perfect opportunity 
                            for me to hone these skills and to really put in my part, I know what I’m capable of and while maybe my confidence may 
                            waver at times I always know how to pick myself back up and get back to work, so if you ever feel this way, it’s gratifying 
                            to know that you’re not the only one that feels this way from time to time, we all do, we are humans the problem is when 
                            you stay there and don’t try to pull yourself out of the hole, that's when you truly fail.

							We had our first Demo today, and we did well for the most part, a new person joined our call today apparently the client
                           has a tech guide which is helping them and he asked a lot of questions, we failed in explaining the bigger picture of the project
                           and we almost put rope around our neck, there were something when trying to explain the project we missed some important stuff
                           in all honesty I wanted to say something about that but I couldn't press the mic button out of fear of making things worse, but
                           that's the problem! If I keep up like this things will only be worse! I learned my lesson, there's nothing like real experiences to learn.

                            Still haven’t had the chance to watch some of the monthly videos, I might watch one later, if I did you’ll never see this 
                            text if I didn't do well, more work for next week! I’ve also made a game plan with my mentors to learn more about JS and 
                            MERN as a whole to get the knowledge necessary to achieve a great project, and it doesn't hurt that they learn as well 
                            since nodejs seems to be growing in popularity, I’ll give it a shot, it never hurts to have more guns at you side.
