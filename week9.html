                            This is our first week of the new phase called open source, in this phase we will be doing a contribution to an issue of a language we like, for my choice, I went with Python as my first choice but when it comes to the second one I am still stuck on 2: Java and Ruby, they both seem interesting with their own pros and cons but it will define my future path working here at Nearsoft Encora, so the decision seems to be very important.
                            <br><br>
                            I’ve been learning more about github as a whole this last month and this week as well with how branches and working with a team in a github repository, this week I learned about issues from github open source projects. I was recommended by my academy partners to search specifically for “good first issue” to have an easy and valid contribution and while it does help i really limits my options a bit in some cases, for example, scikit-learn has around 1,500 issues more or less but limiting to only “good first issue” reduces me to only 15 issues which really limits my options, even more when some of them are documentation only.
                            <br><br>
                            Some of the repos i’ve been looking at were auto-sklearn, numpy, scikit-image and scikit-learn. Which have their own ways to do on which branch to work on, installation, commit messages, how new issues work and also the push and pull request. Also be careful with some “open” issues, read some of the comments and look at it well because they may just be closed issues, the great thing is that since it’s python theres a lot of active members who love to help people who are barely starting which just increases the morale of new users like me.
                            <br><br>
                            There is no viewing or reading material for this month, well besides all the information on the language I chose and the issues, which by itself is going to be a lot, which means that I won’t be speaking on any books I’ve read this week, but I plan on continuing those endeavors by myself.
